# Capstone Project YelpCamp
A full-stack yelp-like web application developed for camping enthusiasts to search, review and create campgrounds.

I used RESful routing principles to create, view, update, and destroy capmpgrounds and comments when users are signed in. Additional features include: CSS3 background animation on landing page, fuzzy search, campground location with Google Maps, authentication flash messages and in-app notifications, displayed time since post was created, and pagination.

Deployed with Heroku at https://polar-river-16279.herokuapp.com/
